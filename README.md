# Multimodal Detection and Analysis of Parkinson Disease

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a central nervous system neurodegenerative condition that causes temporary or permanent loss of
motor movements, speech, and mental processes. Parkinson’s disease (PD) is distinguished by characterized by a wide spectrum
of movement and non-movement symptoms that can affect function to varying degrees. Unfortunately, PD is difficult to diagnose
because there are no conventional diagnostic tests or systems that can be relied upon for accurate results. While the Unified
Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) is recommended as a first-line for monitoring Parkinson’s disease progression, it must
be administered by a neurologist, therefore it’s not a good tool for evaluating short-term variations in the disease state. For this
reason, neurologists need to use automated diagnostic technologies to aid them. The study focuses on the development of a system
for estimating the prevalence of a person’s Parkinson’s disease (PD) symptoms by remotely monitoring numerical interpretations
of their regular motor movements as movement disorders escalate. The research has also focused on the identification of the vocal
impairments in Parkinson’s disease patients flowing speech or vowel rhythm. Parkinson’s patients with a more severe form of
the condition sketch spiral at a slower pace and with less pressure. Hence, the proposed method uses Composite Feature Score
(CFS) of Motor Movements (M), Sketching (S) & Pen Pressure (P) and Vocal Impairments (V) features to evaluate the severity
of Parkinson’s disease (PD) with a need to find parameters that have a greater link so that they can be taken into account for an
appropriate diagnosis. Diverse multi-feature processing techniques have been utilized in the study to extract and compute valuable
features to develop accurate scores for evaluating PD decision-support systems.
